    <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I grew up studing classical ballet throughout my high school career. Ballet has left a positive impact on my life, deepended my love for the arts, and taught me valuable lessons. Through ballet, I have learned self-discipline, determination, perseverance, and team work. In my free time I enjoy yoga, journaling, and spending time with family and friends. I am also eager to go biking more in the future and explore hiking trails.</p>
